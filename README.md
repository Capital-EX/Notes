# ~Nötes~

~Nötes is a small application that can be used to both draw and type notes. Text is stored on "stick notes" that can be freely placed around the screen.~

~A rework of [Note-It](https://github.com/Capital-EX/Note-It) in lua using and the [LÖVE](https://www.love2d.org) and [GÖÖi](https://github.com/tavuntu/gooi).
Android apk built using [Martin Felis's Love for Android](https://bitbucket.org/MartinFelis/love-android-sdl2).~

Terrible hot mess of an "app".  Created in a month for a high school project.

This app used a hand made implentation of a textarea.  It was a nightmare to make and is near impossible to fix.
